This is a repository for a Music Festival. The main goal of the site is to showcase my basic abilities using HTML and to improve practices to make a responsive site. Also to start my first steps with JavaScript and SASS.

This website has a header with a video and a navegation bar, 4 sections: about the festival, line up, gallery and tickets. Also has a footer.

If you want to see this website live, you can go to: [Music Festival Project](https://splendorous-cobbler-940a86.netlify.app/).
